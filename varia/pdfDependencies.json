// to be able to view the PDF files inside the app, you need to creat a development build before.
// check the Expo documentation for details - https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/
// after the build is complte, install following dependecies:

{
    "dependencies": {

      "react-native-blob-util": "^0.19.2", 
      "react-native-pdf": "^6.7.1",    
    },

{
  "plugins": [
    "@config-plugins/react-native-blob-util",
    "@config-plugins/react-native-pdf"
